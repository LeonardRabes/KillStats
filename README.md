KillStats is a Team Fortress 2 tool to get additional statistics to your strange items. It is possible to track your overall performance and see some long term information. 

### First Startup:
When you start the application for the first time it will look like this:

* open your profile in the steam application, right click on the page and press ""Copy Page URL"

#### ...and API key to use the programm.
* Click [this](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) link and login with your steam account. Then you will be asked if you have a domain (if you don't, just type "none" into the textbox). When you have answered the question your steam API key will be shown.

After you entered both you can click save and the programm will restart.

### Select Items:
When KillStats is restarted it will present you a list of your strange items, that are useable for tracking. Click on a item you want to track and push the select button. As you can see it added this particular item to the tracking list. If you cant find your wanted weapon/cosmetic use the search bar in the left lower corner.
